=========================
Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.

No. As the argument given is a pointer to an array, it can't know its size beforehand. However, it gives a segmentation fault when it passes the allocated destination memory area.

=======================
(Optionally) Please write the your implementation method in readme text file whether you use pointer notation for the extra credit. 

I used pointer notation.

=======================
I did this assignment last semester. I spent, I think, about two days to finish the assignement.
